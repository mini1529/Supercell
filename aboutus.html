  <h2>ABOUT US</h2>

  <p style="margin-bottom:40px;">
    In the summer of 2010, Supercell was born.<br>
    Back then, the founders had no idea what the company would become.<br>
    They just knew they wanted to make great games that people would play for years.<br>
    To do so, they would create a new kind of gaming company.
